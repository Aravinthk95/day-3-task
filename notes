COMPARISON OF THE TWO JSON OBJ:

          We can compare the two JSON obj in the same way because in the both the properties the content are 
same but the difference is the place of the content only differ in the OBJ1; the order is like 
{name: "person 1", age;5}; but in the OBJ2; the order is like the {age:5, name: "person 1"}; the all are 
alike.
